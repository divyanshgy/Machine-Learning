# Machine-Learning
 Implementation of ML Algorithms on different datasets.
 1) Single variable Linear Regression on the kaggle housing dataset.
 2) Multiple variable Linear Regression on the kaggle housing dataset.
 3) Logistic Regression on the IRIS dataset. Results- achieved an accuracy of 0.97 and an f1-score of 0.96
 4) Support Vector Machine(SVM) algorithm on the IRIS dataset. Results- achieved an accuracy of 0.97 and f1-score of 0.95
 5) Random Forest algorithm on the IRIS dataset. Improved results significantly- achieved an accuracy of 0.99 and f1-score of 0.99
 6) K-means clustering on the kaggle country clustering dataset. Obtained optimal value of K using elbow method and WCSS.
 7) Principal Component Analysis algorithm on randomly created gene data.
 8) Prediction of Heart Disease using Decision Trees on the UCI Heart Disease Dataset. Initially predicted 74% and 79% correctly as not having and having heart disease respectively. To improve the results, obtained the optimal value of alpha for Pruning the tree and performed 5-fold cross validation. Results improved significantly to predicting 81% and 85% correctly as not having and having heart disease respectively.
 9) Trained Neural Network to recognize Handrwitten Digits, used the MNIST dataset on kaggle. Used softmax and ReLu activation functions and got an accuracy of 97.3% using only 3 epochs.
